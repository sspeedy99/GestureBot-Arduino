# GestureBot-Arduino
Freshmen year engineering project, a hand gesture bot which uses Arduino as micro-controller and moves on the direction based on hand gesture. 
This bot uses a micro-controler, a wrist band which include a MPU6050 gyroscopic sensor which ditects the direction sensor of the hand,and a RX 443Mhz transmitter which is used to transmit the gesture to the Reciever of the bot.
This project is completed in three sprints;
Sprint 1: Sprint one consists of creating a wrist band controller consistin an Arduino NANO and RF transmitter and gyro sensors which  is used for sending the data to the reciever.
Sprint 2: Sprint two is to create a chassis of the car which is having an Arduino MEGA and RF reciever and L298N motor driver. The chassis consists of four driving motors in provide better wheelbase.
Sprint 3: Sprint three is to create a hood which can rise and come at its mean position at the sense of the gesture.
